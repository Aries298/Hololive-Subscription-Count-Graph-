# Hololive-Subscription-Count-Graph-
Script which gets the numbers of subscriptions and orders them in a matplotlib graph.
It uses 3 predefined lists containing necessary data:

arrholo - contains the names of YT Channels / Name of Youtuber which will be shown on the graph

arrcolors - contains the HEX color that'll be shown on the graph

urlist - contains YT Channels' URLs to get info from

After compiling, the script produces a single .png file being an image of a graph
